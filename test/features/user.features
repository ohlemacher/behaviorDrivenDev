Feature: RESTful server
    In order to play with BDD and REST
    As beginners
    We will handle storing, retrieving and deleting user details in a RESTful manner

    Scenario: Retrieve a user's details
        Given some users are in the system
        When I retrieve the user 'david01'
        Then I should get a '200' response
        And the following user details are returned:
            | name |
            | David |
    
    Scenario: Delete an existing user's details
        Given some users are in the system
        When I delete the user 'david01'
        Then I should get a '200' response
        And the message 'User david01 deleted' is returned
        And the user 'david01' is removed
        Then when I retrieve the user 'david01'
        Then I should get a '404' response
        And the message 'User david01 not found' is returned
